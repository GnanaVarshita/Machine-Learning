Bitcoin price prediction using LSTM neural network . This project is done based on the hourly changing price of the bitcoin and predicts the price using 
long short term neural network. This projects can be taken to advance levels by webscraping using the API's so that we can collect data directly from the website 
and predict price contonously .


Another project is Identifying and tracking the depression :
In this project the movements of the individuals is collected using the wearables such as smart watches or mobile phones tracking their movement.
The fundemantal idea of this project is find who are experiencing depression with help of their movement or active hours . Studies say that depressed people stay 
longer and active during nights avoiding sleep or not able to sleep properly . So in this project the activities of individuals are tracked for every hour and based 
on their movemnets activity points are awarded . Based on these numbers the person is classified as depressed or not .
